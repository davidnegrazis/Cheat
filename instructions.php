<p><i>Cheat</i> is a card-game where the goal is to be the first to rid of all your cards.
Each turn, the active player places 1-4 cards face-down so that the other players do not know what they are. The card rank of their turn (i.e. 10s, jacks, aces, etc.)
is what they're <i>supposed</i> to play. The rank of the goal card moves to the subsequent card rank
each round. The order is: numbers ascending, jacks, queens, kings, and then aces. The order loops after aces.<br>
The cards that are placed down do not necessarily match the round's card rank. For example, the goal rank may be
any 7 card, but the active player places down a king. If another player suspects a cheat, they can call the active player's bluff. If any of the cards just placed down were, in fact,
a cheat, then the player who placed them has to pick up all of the cards that have been placed in the pool. If not, the player who falsely
called the bluff needs to pick up all of those cards.<br>
You can only play cards that are in your hand. Sometimes, you'll be forced to cheat if none of your cards match the rank you're supposed to play. You can cheat at any time, though.<br />
Calling a cheat does not progress the turn to the next player. If it's your turn, you can still call cheat on the player that went previously. However, only the player that just placed down cards
can be called out.<br />
